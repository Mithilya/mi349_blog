        <p> You might look at your closet and think, there is no more room to hang 
            anymore of my clothes. A great way to hang more clothes and have a much 
            more efficient use of a closet space are having space saving hangers. 
            Space saving hangers allow you to hang several garments in slots, 
            vertically or horizontally, on one single hanger rack. You can essentially 
            place 5 or 6 plus clothing items on a single hanger rack. You can hang items 
            such as your coats, shirts, pants, purses, accessories, and suits. This is very 
            much ideal for places with small closets such as dorms, apartments, etc. 
            Space saving hangers are great if you want to group certain items by season, 
            weather, occasions, sizes and more. Closets can clutter up real fast with 
            items and space saving hangers can create more room for not only clothing but 
            other items as well. Beware of using wooden hangers, those can bulk up 
            on the hangers. Be sure to use slim plastic hangers to really make the 
            most use of your space. These space saving hangers are not only for 
            clothes but can be used for other purposes as well. Let your imagination 
            flow and customize this system to whatever suits your purpose. Watch this 
            great video by <i>Oh My Goods</i> in order to see how it all comes together:

            <p> Counters can clutter up with several small makeup items leaving you 
                with less space and a mess. In order to save space and organize 
                your makeup, you can make your own magnetic makeup frame. 
                The materials you will need for this project include 1 picture 
                frame of any size, 1 thin magnet sheet that matches the size 
                of your frame, and several small adhesive magnets corresponding 
                to the size of your makeup. Simply place the magnet sheet inside 
                the picture frame. Then, stick the adhesive side of the 
                several small magnets on to your makeup items. Once all your 
                makeup items have magnets on them, place all of your makeup 
                items onto your magnetic makeup frame where they will stay 
                off your counter and on the frame. This is also a great
                way to display your makeup and locate all of your items in a 
                much more efficient and faster way. This project will only 
                take about 20 minutes. The organizer is not only limited to 
                makeup items, but can be versatile for other purposes as well. 
                Let your imagination flow and customize this system to whatever 
                suits your purpose. Watch this great video by
