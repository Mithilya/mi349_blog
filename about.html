    <p>Hi! I am Mithilya Srinivasan. I am 21 years old 
        and currently a junior at Michigan State University 
        majoring in Information Science. After college, 
        I am hoping to pursue a career as a UX (User Experience) designer. 
        Writing a blog has always been something on my to-do list and I 
        can finally check it off because here I am writing a blog.</p>

    <p>Here I am writing a blog about organizing things because 
        that is one of the things in my life that captures my interest. 
        There is nothing better than putting two things of your interest 
        into one. There are millions of items at home you can organize, 
        and I am here to help serve and spread ideas to everyone on ways 
        to declutter, make a more efficient use of space, and locate items faster etc.</p>
